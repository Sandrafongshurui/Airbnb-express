This sojourn allows one a presence with the environment, to embark on adventures around the island, and be at ease afterward. Your occasional companions include moonlit mist-laden trades, the subtle glow of the Milky Way, and peaceful morning light as melodic birds dart about the lanai. An alluring and thought-provoking hop to the misty mountain, from Hilo or Kona, will bring you to the edge of a lush and verdant rain forest where the cabin dwells. Follow a stairway to the lanai, then passage to the entry, kitchen and living space. A second flight leads high aloft to a king bed, half bath and musings of forest and sky. The sublime of nature and place of restorative tranquility within the native rain forest.  We value, respect, and are considerate with our community and our commons. ",

If you just want to hang around the property, you will have plenty of options for entertainment as well. Take a dip in the oceanfront pool or soothe the muscles in the hot tub. Practice your putting on the putting green. Grab some meat and grill up a lunch or dinner on the propane barbecue facilities and stop in to the Sandwitch Bar/Deli for a drink. Lastly stop in to the onsite activity desk to book an excursion around the island! This one bedroom/one bathro",

The area is well served by minibuses, City Bus, taxis, and the old style Hong Kong tram. The MTR is a two minute walk from the flat.

Located north of Little Italy, Nolita was originally considered part of Little Italy but has gradually lost most of its recognizable Italian character. As trendy restaurants, bars and boutiques popped up in Nolita’s winding streets, the area started developing a separate identity from the surrounding neighborhoods. Similar to SoHo, Nolita is known for its architecture and “hip” reputation. However, Nolita lacks the high density of tourists that flock to its neighbors, allowing for a more local feel. Known for its fashionable retail, young residents and expensive apartments, Nolita is slowly splitting from its association with SoHo and Little Italy, maturing into a full-fledged neighborhood.

Near many subway stops (including the R train 1/2 block away), easy to get to Manhattan; four blocks from Prospect Park; near to the Brooklyn Botanic Garden and Brooklyn Museum.  You'll have the best of both worlds: you'll be in a fun, hip, laid-back neighborhood, but close to the sights and action of Manhattan! The apartment is a duplex with two large bedrooms, two full baths, terrace, fully stocked kitchen, dw, wi-fi.   Note: On dates the apartment is marked unavailable on the calendar, one bedroom/bath in the apartment often is available (view my related listing, \"Sunny, Large, Park Slope Bedroom\").  You would be sharing the place with me - and my cat. Extended stays and a willingness to take care of my wonderful cat yield a discount! I'd greatly appreciate it if you would make an inquiry so we can e-chat for a bit before sending an offer.",

You'll need to walk one flight of stairs to reach there, and enjoy a nice view of rooftop. Self check-in available. The apartment is located at the rooftop with lots of windows. The space is small but very bright, cozy and well organised. Big roof space just outside the door. Great for chilling and enjoy a bit of a view in our city (full of buildings). The three beds are all single bed size (one single bed and another one with a slide out single bed, you can check out the photos).  We will prepare clean towels and bed linens for you.

It's almost like a resort when you walk into the apartment complex. You'll have access to the swimming pool and gym, but it'll be extra pay per visit. I can give you tips about wandering around in Hong Kong. If I'm free to hang out, can even show you around & go hiking together! If you're interested in art, I can take you to my art studio which is located in an art centre.  Btw, my parents can have simple conversation in English and are very friendly people. You'll also get a taste of living among locals in hk. Green & peaceful neighbourhood. Can have a nice walk or run by the water 10 minutes walk/ 1 minute mini",

Sarah Jessica Parker lives across the street, in case you are into celebrity spotting.  Since I moved in recently, most of the furniture is brand new. There is a queen-sized bed, a sofa-bed, a TV-stand, a table, two chairs and shelves. The bathroom has a bath tub, and it's as bright as the main room, thanks to a skylight.

The room is really big, about 10 meters, with a big closet that you can use, a desk, a mirror, a seat and television. It has a window but only it gives conference to the building since it is an interior flat. The room is in the entry, so enter to the room is very easy. The bath is in the corridor.

Or go to Sants Station which is 10 minutes walking. The nearest underground is the (Blue) L5 station Entença, buses are 54, V9, H8, 59...

The large balcony has views of the ocean and even glimpses of the city skyline. What we love about our place is its eclectic style and huge breezy balcony plus the way the apartment stays so cool even on the hottest days.  It’s really just a stones throw from the beach and to the shops but still quiet enough to enjoy some privacy. Our place is spotless with the freshest of linen for every bed!! White fluffy towels and the best Smart TV ever with YouTube and internet.  There are plenty of kid friendly toys & games plus books as well. Common areas out the front of the apartment and the balcony You can call me anytime and I am happy to give tips on all things fun, social and foody. As much or as little engagement as you wish The beach is literally a stones throw as are the shops & buses, with the main bus terminal 30 metres away. Buses from here take you to ",

Technically accommodates two but best for one. Roof access means top floor of the walk-up building: no elevator. Feel free to message me with any questions! This is a nice, clean, relaxed but small space perfect for travelers after a long day in the city.  This bedroom includes full closet space that is located in the living room. 95% of the time I will be hosting from my own private room in the space and greeting guests. If not, I'll be nearby to help with anything anytime. 5th floor walk-up, no elevator (the charm of a classic old east village building) Full bathroom, living room with video games, basic cable, Netflix, hulu, rooftop and full kitchen",
