An alluring and thought-provoking hop to the misty mountain, from Hilo or Kona, will bring you to the edge of a lush and verdant rain forest where the cabin dwells. Follow a stairway to the lanai, then passage to the entry, kitchen and living space. A second flight leads high aloft to a king bed, half bath and musings of forest and sky.
